### Georgetown Capstone
I worked with [Anthea Watson Strong](http://www.antheawatsonstrong.com/#about) and [Sujit Ray](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sujitkray) during the Spring 2016 cohort of the [Georgetown School of Continuing Studies Data Science Certificate Program](http://scs.georgetown.edu/programs/375/data-science/) to complete a capstone project. The project used data from a media organization application with the goal of predicting the type of content a user wanted to listen to at a given time.
