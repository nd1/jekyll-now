I signed the #100DaysofCommits pledge with [Women Who Code](https://medium.com/@WomenWhoCodeDC/100-days-of-commits-60af0abe8825#.52a3yfxma).

Here is the description from the main [100 Days of Commits](https://100daysofcommits.github.io/index.html) site:

"#100DaysOfCommits is a community project that's partnering with local coding meetups. We want to encourage people to get involved in Open Source and to start their own side projects. There's a raffle involved!"

The site has info on how to participate.

My commit record, so far, is 19 of 21 consecutive days so I am hoping to beat that. I am not sure I will make all 100, but I will try. I am going to start out with working my way through the coding exercises in [Think Stats](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034094.do).  I also have a (rough) data scraper I wrote to pull some city data for a project I just did. I am planning on cleaning up the code and seeing if it can be a [Code for DC](http://codefordc.org/index.html) project.
