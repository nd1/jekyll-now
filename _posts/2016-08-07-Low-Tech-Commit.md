title: Low Tech Commit
---

I am really glad right now that I have this site set up on github so I can claim a commit with a quick post instead of coding. I have been going non-stop for the past 12 hours and, other than dinner and a quick phone call with my dad earlier, I have not sat down all day. I am too tired to try to do any coding now.

In addition to loving tech, I also love a lot of low-tech hobbies. I am a [Master Food Preserver](http://nchfp.uga.edu/questions/FAQ_general.html#1), I knit, I spin yarn, and sometimes I will sew myself something new to wear. I also cook a lot- we (my partner and I) rarely eat out around here. I am in two CSAs and go to the farmers market at least once a week. Today was a big day for canning and I had a few things that needed to be used up. 

I documented everything I did on my [instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/knitnicknit/). Here is a list in the order they appear there:

* Bison jerky with a (hopefully) slightly spicy profile: soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, red pepper flakes, seasoned pepper, Aleppo pepper, and espelette pepper, and a few hits of my [favorite hot sauce](http://woodberry-kitchen.myshopify.com/products/snake-oil-hot-sauce-1)
* Italian style pickled raw baby eggplant: first time I have tried this. It will make its tasting debut on a pickle snack plate when we host friends for dinner Saturday.
* Pickled Okra: A former co-worker of my partner's sister claimed he and his wife nearly got divorced over their unwillingness to share these pickles with one another. He also claimed to eat it while sitting naked in the tub. (As a pickle lover myself, I take this as high praise.)
* 8 quarts of roma tomatoes: purchased at the farmers market from [one of my favortie farms](http://www.garnersproduce.com/). I canned them as 3 quarts and 10 pints. We use them a lot in the winter to braise meats and will probably do one more batch before the end of the month.
* 7 quarts of peaches in light syrup: purchased from my [favorite orchard](http://www.blackrockorchard.com/about.html). They are a regular at the farmers market and sometimes we get to go visit them at the orchard. We almost didn't have peaches this summer because we had a really cold spring and a frost after the peaches started growing. 
* Peach Infused Brandy: this is all Vince (my partner). He loves infusing things and what better way to use all the peach scraps (they will get composted afterward). Emily from BlackRock also gave me a bunch of over ripe peaches this morning that went into the brandy with enough leftover for some peach infused vodka. I think we will be having some peachy sidecars with that eggplant Saturday night.
* [LUVEYâ€™S EIGHT DAY SWEET PICKLE CHIPS](http://www.mrswheelbarrow.com/2010/06/luveys-eight-day-sweet-pickle-chips/): I never got around to making any last summer and I regretted it.
* Ground Cherry and Tomatillo Salsa: this is almost gone. It was my first time using ground cherries and they are so good! We snacked on it while canning, ate a bunch with grilled steaks for dinner, and the small amount left went into Vince's lunch salads.
* [Chinese Smashed Cucumbers With Sesame Oil and Garlic](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017629-chinese-smashed-cucumbers-with-sesame-oil-and-garlic): my lunch salad for the next few days. Vince doesn't care for cucumbers so it is all mine.
