title: Status - 100DaysofCommits

As noted previously, I [signed the #100DaysofCommits pledge](http://www.nicoledonnelly.me/100DaysOfCommits/). Today is Day 5, and this post will be my commit for today.

So far I have managed at least one commit per day. You can track my progress on [twitter](https://twitter.com/NicoleADonnelly). This week I have been working on putting together a [public facing repo](https://github.com/nd1/DC_RestaurantViolationForecasting) for a recent Capstone project I completed. I worked on the code a bit, including creating a pipeline for the modeling. I did some work on the metric computation too. I submitted the project to PyDataDC. If accepted, I will give a talk to walk through a project end to end for novice data scientists.

5 days down, 95 to go!
