I will be speaking at [PyDataDC](http://pydata.org/dc2016/) in October.

I am a recovering consultant who left a career in computer forensics and electronic discovery to combine my love of technology and passion for problem solving with data science. I believe a city that consumes and understands its own data is acting in the true spirit of public service by improving the lives of its residents and hope to continue to explore this further as the open data movement grows. 

I am affiliated with [District Data Labs](https://www.districtdatalabs.com/research-lab) where I am researching Entity Resolution in Health Care. I am leading a project at [Code for DC](http://codefordc.org/index.html) to pull [DC Department of Health insepction report data](http://dc.healthinspections.us/webadmin/dhd_431/web/index.cfm?a=Main) and make it easily accessible. I regularly attend [Women Data Scientists DC](http://www.meetup.com/WomenDataScientistsDC/) meetups and am a member of [Women Who Code DC](https://www.womenwhocode.com/dc).

I have a professional certificate in data science from Georgetown University and am the programâ€™s teaching assistant. I have completed the Data Science Immersive program at General Assembly and have Bachelors degrees from Rutgers University in Computer Science and Art History. When I am not wrangling data, I enjoy magically transforming the wooly coats of domesticated ruminants into objects that are both pretty and practical.
